# Leaflet Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## The Task

1. **Get the data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every few minutes. 
   Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 
   
   In this case, I used all earthquakes from the last 7 days.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

   * Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.

### Level 2: More Data

 <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

* Plotted the tectonic plates on the map.

* Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out the two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Added layer controls to the map.
